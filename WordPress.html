<h1>Word Press Project Website and Reflection</h1>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://refereeequipment.wordpress.com">My Website</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The 3 websites I used</h2>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.referee.com/">Website #1 Referee</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/a/referee-supplies-0axz00a.html">Website #2 Dicks Sporting Goods</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.refreps.com/">Webiste #3 Refreps</a></li>
</ul>
<p> How these websites helped me with my word press project is that I used the font and i really liked on how it looked.</p>

<h1>My Experience with Wordpress</h1>
<p>My experience with wordpress was tough at first when I didn't know much of what to do but when I went on it for everyday I got used to it, and like how to use the tools correctly. What I mostly used was the image button because for my project I did insert a bunch of images and it was easy to use. The most challenging thing on word press in my opinion was on how many tools their were, it was a lot of tools that you can use for your website but I only needed the text box, columns, and image insert box. </p>
