## My Experience with Wordpress

My experience with wordpress was tough at first when I didn't know much of what to do but when I went on it for everyday I got used to it, and like how to use the tools correctly. What I mostly used was the image button because for my project I did insert a bunch of images and it was easy to use. The most challenging thing on word press in my opinion was on how many tools their were, it was a lot of tools that you can use for your website but I only needed the text box, columns, and image insert box.
