# Algebra ll Factoring Notes

* For all polynomials, first factor out the greatest common factor (also knwon as the GCF). We will show you a step by step on how to solve factor.






# Here's an example of factoring














## STEP BY STEP ON HOW TO SOLVE FACTORING (Algebra ll)

|STEPS|EXAMPLE    |EXPLANATION|
|-----|-----------|-----------|
|  1  |42x^5-48x^4|First you observe the equation because you want to take out the greatest common factor out of it|
|  2  |\frac{42x^5}{6x^4}|The GCF of this equation is 6x^4, therefore we should divide by 6x^4 on both numbers 42x^5 and 48x^4|
|  3  |\frac{-48x^4}{6x^4}|Here is the second part of the divsion part|
|  4  |6x^4(7x-8)|Solution.|
