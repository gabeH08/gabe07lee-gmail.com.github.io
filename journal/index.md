This is my Journal!

- Terminal: Allows you to code.
- Git: Allows us to control our files.
- Vim: Allows you to edit.
- Markdown: It is an easier way to create a text.

- Right now I'm feeling somewhat comfertable about this new techonology but I still need to learn more about this new unit plus study and read the textbooks    that Mr.Jones assigned.

- An advice I would give to the future students is to submit work on time, study for quiz every class, and focus when Mr. Jones is speaking because he could say important information that can help you with your assignment.
